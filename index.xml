We are also a place where these cookbooks will always get maintained moving forward.
While these cookbooks are great, when we typically take over management of the cookbook repos they are not in the best of states, and there is significant work to bring them up to our standards.
We also have all our existing cookbooks (of which there are over 70) and as our standards change, we need to deploy these changes across all of our repositories.</description></item><item><title>Cookbook Support</title><link>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/cookbook-support/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/cookbook-support/</guid><description>Cookbook support is a complicated subject based on many variables, however this document should outline expectations in our cookbooks
Semver We follow semver, this is never optional to our cookbooks, and allows you, our consumers, to understand the change we are making and the potential impact on your environment.
Cookbook Support We will attempt to support the version of the Chef Infra Client that Chef Software supports unless there is a compelling reason not to, such as:</description></item><item><title>Community Leaders 2019</title><link>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/sous-board-2019/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/sous-board-2019/</guid><description>Thank you all for voting on the board of Sous-Chefs Community Leaders. Voting has now closed and the results are in.
Farewells We would like to wish our fond farewells to the members of the board who have chosen to step down: Dan and Joseph have been instrumental in Sous-Chefs and will be missed. Some of their great achievements are:
The direction and rewrite of resource driven cookbooks that has been a great uptake in the community CI improvements that make releasing cookbooks easy and safe Rewriting the Apache2 cookbook We wish them all the best and hope that they remain active members of the community</description></item><item><title>Community Leaders Nominations 2019</title><link>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/community-leaders/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 20:24:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/community-leaders/</guid><description>Time has rolled around again and we&amp;rsquo;re looking to elect a new set of community leaders. Ideally we&amp;rsquo;re looking for three fresh new faces!
Tim, Dan and Joseph have been working hard in the background for the past three years and we&amp;rsquo;re looking to shake things up.
What&amp;rsquo;s Involved You&amp;rsquo;re looking to shape the direction of a great community, you have ideas that can help an OpenSource community grow.
You like to keep things ticking along, supporting shipping some of the most used cookbooks in the Chef community.</description></item><item><title>Chef License Change</title><link>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/chef-licensing-change/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/chef-licensing-change/</guid><description>Sous Chefs, as one of the most active communities around Chef, we felt it would be useful and appropriate to respond to the recent announcements from Chef.
What does this mean for us For us, this announcement does not have any major changes or impact, we manage and supply community resources to the ecosystem, mainly through cookbooks; Apache2, Redisio, Nginx, Haproxy are the most popular amongst the 50 we maintain. Alongside tooling such as the language-chef plugin for atom, and expect our community tooling to increase in the future.</description></item><item><title>2019-02-25 Sous-Chefs Meeting</title><link>https://sous-chefs.org/minutes/2019-02-25/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sous-chefs.org/minutes/2019-02-25/</guid><description>apache2 release This week we released Apache2!
We&amp;rsquo;re looking for user configurations to test backwards compatability.

Nginx is going to be modelled after apache2 style
AOB Best Practises Update of our best practices:
Low level of abstractions, it should be as close to the documentation as possible Opinionated Don&amp;rsquo;t make the simple things hard to do, just to meet a niche use case Cookbooks are made to serve the 95% use case Low maintenance overhead Thursdays PR Help Session Enable people with little experience to get up to speed Help people open PRs or perspective Catch-up with inflight PRs Follow the thought process of reworking cookbooks Bone Yard We&amp;rsquo;re looking to start a Boneyard similar to Chef Boneyard, for Sous-chefs cookbooks that we don&amp;rsquo;t actively maintain.</description></item><item><title>2019-02-18 Sous-Chefs Meeting</title><link>https://sous-chefs.org/minutes/2019-02-18/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sous-chefs.org/minutes/2019-02-18/</guid><description>Best Practices Sous-Chefs Best practises has been released.

We&amp;rsquo;ve had quite a year, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d summarize the major moments. Here we go!
2018 was a pretty big year in Sous-Chefs, we started on OpenCollective to raise funds for our core contributors. Many hours go into rewriting, maintaining, and reviewing pull requests.

The first step is the desire to improve the project.
Quick-contribute Create an issue on the GitHub issue tracker (see issues_url in the cookbook&amp;rsquo;s metadata.rb) Link to your patch as a rebased git branch or pull request from the ticket We regularly review contributions and will get back to you if we have any suggestions or concerns.</description></item><item><title>Cookbook Best Practices</title><link>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/best-practices/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:14:39 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/best-practices/</guid><description>If we&amp;rsquo;re adopting a cookbook and trying to bring it up to scratch, these are likely the first things people will expect.
Platform Support We will attempt to support all operating systems releases currently supported by the OS vendor except where there is a compelling reason not to.
Current major operating system support lies in the following:
Centos Ubuntu Redhat Amazon Linux 2 macOS Windows Some cookbooks are not designed to support all of these operating systems.</description></item><item><title>Forking to Sous Chefs</title><link>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/forking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:14:39 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/forking/</guid><description>Where it is not possible to contact the existing owner and transfer ownership to the sous-chefs, we can take over maintenance of a codebase by creating a hard fork.
Adoption Note If adopting an existing cookbook you must use the current name to carry on support for the existing user base. In this case please see cookbook transferring
Before you begin A hard fork is not the friendliest approach, so we should make no other options are available.</description></item><item><title>Leaving Sous Chefs</title><link>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/departure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:14:39 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/departure/</guid><description>If a maintainer wants to stop or leave, it&amp;rsquo;s cool. We&amp;rsquo;ll gladly point to the project&amp;rsquo;s new home and keep an archive of the old history.
When the cookbook is for end-of-life tech If a cookbook is for software that&amp;rsquo;s no longer feasible to keep running, like old open source, old commercial stuff, anything that can&amp;rsquo;t be downloaded; then we update the cookbook README.md to mark as deprecated.
When the cookbook is unused If a cookbook seems entirely unused, we may want to stop claiming it is maintained.</description></item><item><title>Licenses</title><link>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/licenses/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:14:39 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://sous-chefs.org/docs/licenses/</guid><description>Table of Contents Table of Contents Software License Apache License LICENSE file Apache License Header Apache License in the README Documentation License Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International LICENSE File Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Icon Software License The preferred software license to publish the work of Sous Chefs is Apache License.
