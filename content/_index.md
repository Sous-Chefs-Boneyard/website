The Sous Chefs are a community of Chef cookbook maintainers working together to maintain important cookbooks. We also adopt cookbooks that are looking for a new home because the maintainer has moved on from using Chef or does not want the burden of maintaining it themselves anymore.

## Join Us

There are over 50 Sous Chefs maintaining dozens of cookbooks, and hundreds of people who participate in our community.

To join us, drop into the Chef Community Slack in the [#sous-chefs](https://chefcommunity.slack.com/messages/sous-chefs/) channel. If you don't already have an account you can [grab one here](http://community-slack.chef.io/).
