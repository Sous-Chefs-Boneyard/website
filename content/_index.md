Who are the Sous Chefs?

The Sous Chefs are a community of Chef cookbook maintainers working together to maintain important cookbooks. We also adopt cookbooks that are looking for a new home because the maintainer has moved on from using Chef or does not want the burden of maintaining it themselves anymore. You can learn more about Sous Chefs in [this video from ChefConf 2017.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-g3mNO-eN8)

There are over 50 Sous Chefs committers maintaining dozens of cookbooks, and hundreds of people who participate in our community. To join us, please read our joining us page, or drop into the Chef Community Slack in the #sous-chefs channel
