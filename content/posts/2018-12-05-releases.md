Hello, this is Joseph Holsten from Sous Chefs. This is the first time I've put together a cookbook releases announcement, so please tell me what I could make better. Or stop doing terribly!

## [`redisio`](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/redisio) - Major release & new maintainers!

### [3.0.0](https://github.com/sous-chefs/redisio/compare/v2.7.2...v3.0.0) - 2018-11-27

- This cookbook is now maintained by the Sous Chefs. If you're interested in helping with maintenance or learning more check out https://sous-chefs.org/. Thank you Brian Bianco for the work you've done over the years on this cookbook. We'll be sure to take good care of it.
- This cookbook now requires Chef 13 or later
- Incompatibilities with the latest selinux_policy cookbook have been resolved by using Chef's built in selinux helpers
- All Chefstyle warnings have been resolved
- Contributing.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files have been added
- The build_essential resource is now directly used so that the built in resource in Chef 14+ can be used. This increases the required build-essential cookbook to 5.0+
- Duplicate dependencies in the Berksfile have been removed
- The chefignore file has been updated to prevent more unnecessary files from being uploaded to the chef server
- Data bags are now loaded with the data_bag_item helper instead of Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load directly
- Testing has been updated to use Delivery Local Mode which is built into ChefDK. The legacy Rakefile, Vagrantfile, Thorfile, and Cheffile have been removed
- Platforms in Test Kitchen configurations have been updated and dokken images are now used in dokken

## [`sc-chruby`](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/sc-chruby) - initial release!

- Includes a resource to install [`chruby`](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby).

## [`selinux_policy`](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/selinux_policy) 2.3.2 - fixes & cleanup

### [2.3.2](https://github.com/sous-chefs/selinux_policy/compare/v2.3.1...v2.3.2) - 2018-11-29

- Cache which helper method calls

### [2.3.1](https://github.com/sous-chefs/selinux_policy/compare/v2.3.0...v2.3.1) - 2018-11-29

#### Fixed

-  Use `chef/mixin/which` to locate selinux binaries. Fixes [#85](https://github.com/sous-chefs/selinux_policy/issues/85) & [#93](https://github.com/sous-chefs/selinux_policy/issues/93)

### [2.3.0](https://github.com/sous-chefs/selinux_policy/compare/v2.2.0...v2.3.0) - 2018-11-27

- Further fixes for the earlier refactoring
- Repair CI jobs

## [`grafana`](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/grafana) 3.0.1 - platform updates

### [3.0.1](https://github.com/sous-chefs/grafana/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1) - 2018-11-27

- Add support for amazon. Chef 13 and later identifies platform_family as 'amazon': <https://docs.chef.io/deprecations_ohai_amazon_linux.html>
- Update to Grafana 5.3.4
- Drop support for Ubuntu 14.04
- Add support for Ubuntu 18.04

Thanks for sticking with me, that wasn't too bad, was it? See you next week (but probably on monday instead of wednesday)!
