Hello, this is Joseph Holsten & Dan Webb from Sous Chefs. We've had quite a year, so I thought I'd summarize the major moments. Here we go!

# 2018 In Review

2018 was a pretty big year in Sous-Chefs, we started on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/sous-chefs) to raise funds for our core contributors. Many hours go into rewriting, maintaining, and reviewing pull requests. It's a great way to give back to those that empower you and your company!

We moved out cookbook testing from TravisCI to CircleCI accross the board, for reliability and speed reasons. We were one of the first organisatons to adopt [Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/) a way of reusing commands and more importantly yaml without losing the expressiveness that comes with CircleCI. Check ours out [here](https://github.com/sous-chefs/orbs)

With the blatent plugs out of the way, onto the cookbooks.
