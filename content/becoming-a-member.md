# Becoming a Member

Join us on the [Chef community slack](https://chefcommunity.slack.com/messages/sous-chefs/), say hi then;

Send a PR to <https://github.com/sous-chefs/terraform-github-org>

Add yourself to: `members.tf` `chef_de_partie.tf`

If there is a cookbook you wish to become a maintainer of then add yourself to that repo's corresponding file e.g. for sc-mongodb, add yourself to `mongodb.tf` (of course after discussing it in slack)
