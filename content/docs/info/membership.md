Who we are

## Board

The board is responsible for those things that are not easily distributed.

- enforce the code of conduct
- enforce licenses
- manage finances
- control access to community services

This list should remain as small as possible. If it is possible to automate, it should be automated.

The board reserves the authority to do any lawful act necessary to operate the community, but we'll try to avoid wielding this hammer as much as possible.

## Current Board Members

- Tim Smith ([@tas50](https://github.com/tas50/))
- Dan Webb ([@damacus](https://github.com/damacus/))

## Maintainers

Folks with complete autonomy over each cookbook. This currently consists of cookbook maintainers.
