Sous Chefs are dedicated to providing a harassment-free cookbook experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of Sous Chefs participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other community members. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Sous Chefs.

Members violating these rules may be asked to leave the organization at the sole discretion of The Sous Chefs board.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
