## Presentation

This year we're aiming to spread the word of Sous-Chefs and increase membership, gaining critical mass with the Chef Community is critical to improving the quality and longevity of the project.

You can see the video (along with a lot more videos from Chef Conf) [on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-g3mNO-eN8)

## Welcome to new members

It's been great to see a new influx of users (too many to mention!) and Chef cookbooks (OSX, Line et al) since ChefConf

## Where Next

We really want to build upon the successes of the last few months and not slip back into solo maintains to great cookbooks. If you're reading this post and are thinking "I'd love to get involved but I don't know how", please drop by out Github thread [I'm new where do I start?](https://github.com/sous-chefs/meta/issues/84).
