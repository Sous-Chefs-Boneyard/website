Thank you all for voting on the board of Sous-Chefs Community Leaders. Voting has now closed and the results are in.

## Farewells

We would like to wish our fond farewells to the members of the board who have chosen to step down: Dan and Joseph have been instrumental in Sous-Chefs and will be missed. Some of their great achievements are:

- The direction and rewrite of resource driven cookbooks that has been a great uptake in the community
- CI improvements that make releasing cookbooks easy and safe
- Rewriting the Apache2 cookbook

We wish them all the best and hope that they remain active members of the community

## Board of 2019

We would like to introduce and welcome the Sous-Chefs board:

### Tim Smith

[Tas50](https://github.com/Tas50) is continuing on in his Leadership position within Sous-Chef. Tim has been pivotal to Sous-Chefs and has aided in writing better cookbooks along with some amazing work for Chef, which has allowed us to automate more testing and test fixes than ever before. We are grateful for his continuing work! with us


### John Roesler

[John](https://github.com/JohnRoesler) is new to the board this year and has been an active member of the Sous-Chefs community. In the last year, he has been working a lot on the [HaProxy cookbook](https://github.com/sous-chefs/haproxy/) along with all the other cookbooks we mange. We are really excited to have him join us!

### Jason Field

[Xorima](https://github.com/Xorima) is new to the board this year and has been active in Sous-Chefs over the past year and he was awarded Awesome Community Chef at ChefConf London. He has been predominantly focused on helping us move to the new CircleCI build pipeline and has worked to ensure all our cookbooks can pass their tests. We look forward to what he has to bring to the board!

We look forward to the work they will do to help the community grown and thrive moving forward

## What does the board do

- Growing the Sous-Chefs Open Source Community
