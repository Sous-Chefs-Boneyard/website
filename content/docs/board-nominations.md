We've reached the time of year to vote in another set of board members.

## What we're looking for

This year we're pushing for a more diverse crowd of maintainers and advocates.
If you can help fill this stop please apply!

## What's in it for me

Fame, glory, riches.

Are not included, but you will get to shape the direction of Sous-Chefs. Read [membership]({{< ref "/docs/membership.md" >}}) for more information about what the board does.
