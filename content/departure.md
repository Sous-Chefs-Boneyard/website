# Leaving Sous Chefs

If a maintainer wants to stop or leave, it's cool. We'll gladly point to the project's new home and keep an archive of the old history.

## When the cookbook is for end-of-life tech

If a cookbook is for software that's no longer feasible to keep running, like old open source, old commercial stuff, anything that can't be downloaded; then we update the cookbook `README.md` to mark as deprecated.

## When the cookbook is unused

If a cookbook seems entirely unused, we may want to stop claiming it is maintained. In that case, we'll update the cookbook `README.md` to mark it as archived.

## When the maintainer wants to leave

If someone objects to the project moving and wants to continue maintenance under the sous-chefs, we add a prominent link to fork on the readme and continue development. People are generally not idiots, so if they have a reason to leave us we should support them.

Otherwise we update the cookbook `README.md` to mark as relocated, at least pointing where the cookbook went.

## Achiving

Regardless of how a project leaves the Sous Chefs, we will keep a copy of the history available so anyone looking for it will know what's happened.

## Permanent removal

We keep a copy of the cookbook's history available for at least a year.

After that, we may delete the repo if we have some reason too. But practically we'll be trying to keep a record of the code's history for as long as we can.
