<p>Sous-Chefs is a community funded organisation and we like to think of ourselves as a home for unloved great cookbooks. We are also a place where these cookbooks will always get maintained moving forward.
While these cookbooks are great, when we typically take over management of the cookbook repos they are not in the best of states, and there is significant work to bring them up to our standards.
We also have all our existing cookbooks (of which there are over 70) and as our standards change, we need to deploy these changes across all of our repositories.</p>

<h2 class=title-summary><a href=https://sous-chefs.org/docs/cookbook-support/>Cookbook Support</a></h2>
<p>Cookbook support is a complicated subject based on many variables, however this document should outline expectations in our cookbooks
Semver We follow semver, this is never optional to our cookbooks, and allows you, our consumers, to understand the change we are making and the potential impact on your environment.
Cookbook Support We will attempt to support the version of the Chef Infra Client that Chef Software supports unless there is a compelling reason not to, such as:</p>

<h2 class=title-summary><a href=https://sous-chefs.org/docs/sous-board-2019/>Community Leaders 2019</a></h2>
<p>Thank you all for voting on the board of Sous-Chefs Community Leaders. Voting has now closed and the results are in.
Farewells We would like to wish our fond farewells to the members of the board who have chosen to step down: Dan and Joseph have been instrumental in Sous-Chefs and will be missed. Some of their great achievements are:
The direction and rewrite of resource driven cookbooks that has been a great uptake in the community CI improvements that make releasing cookbooks easy and safe Rewriting the Apache2 cookbook We wish them all the best and hope that they remain active members of the community</p>

<h2 class=title-summary><a href=https://sous-chefs.org/docs/community-leaders/>Community Leaders Nominations 2019</a></h2>
<p>Time has rolled around again and we&rsquo;re looking to elect a new set of community leaders. Ideally we&rsquo;re looking for three fresh new faces!
Tim, Dan and Joseph have been working hard in the background for the past three years and we&rsquo;re looking to shake things up.
What&rsquo;s Involved You&rsquo;re looking to shape the direction of a great community, you have ideas that can help an OpenSource community grow.
You like to keep things ticking along, supporting shipping some of the most used cookbooks in the Chef community.</p>

<h2 class=title-summary><a href=https://sous-chefs.org/docs/chef-licensing-change/>Chef License Change</a></h2>
<p>Sous Chefs, as one of the most active communities around Chef, we felt it would be useful and appropriate to respond to the recent announcements from Chef.
What does this mean for us For us, this announcement does not have any major changes or impact, we manage and supply community resources to the ecosystem, mainly through cookbooks; Apache2, Redisio, Nginx, Haproxy are the most popular amongst the 50 we maintain. Alongside tooling such as the language-chef plugin for atom, and expect our community tooling to increase in the future.</p>

<h2 class=title-summary><a href=https://sous-chefs.org/docs/year-in-review/>2018 In Review</a></h2>
<p>Hello, this is Joseph Holsten & Dan Webb from Sous Chefs. We&rsquo;ve had quite a year, so I thought I&rsquo;d summarize the major moments. Here we go!
2018 was a pretty big year in Sous-Chefs, we started on OpenCollective to raise funds for our core contributors. Many hours go into rewriting, maintaining, and reviewing pull requests. It&rsquo;s a great way to give back to those that empower you and your company!</p>

<h2 class=title-summary><a href=https://sous-chefs.org/docs/becoming-a-member/>Becoming a Member</a></h2>
<p>Join us on the Chef community slack, and say hi!
Go to: modules/org_membership/main.tf
Click the pencil to &ldquo;Edit this file&rdquo;
To the file, add a resource for your github user. If your username was dmr, you would add:
resource "github_membership" "dmr" { username = "dmr" role = "member" } Write a commit message. For the above, a reasonable message might be org_membership: add dmr</p>

<h2 class=title-summary><a href=https://sous-chefs.org/docs/code-of-conduct/>Code of Conduct</a></h2>
<p>Sous Chefs are dedicated to providing a harassment-free cookbook experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of Sous Chefs participants in any form.
All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other community members. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Sous Chefs.</p>

<h2 class=title-summary><a href=https://sous-chefs.org/docs/contributing/>Contributing to Sous Chefs</a></h2>
<p>We are glad you want to contribute to a sous-chefs cookbook! The first step is the desire to improve the project.
Quick-contribute Create an issue on the GitHub issue tracker (see issues_url in the cookbook&rsquo;s metadata.rb) Link to your patch as a rebased git branch or pull request from the ticket We regularly review contributions and will get back to you if we have any suggestions or concerns.</p>

<h2 class=title-summary><a href=https://sous-chefs.org/docs/best-practices/>Cookbook Best Practices</a></h2>
<p>If we&rsquo;re adopting a cookbook and trying to bring it up to scratch, these are likely the first things people will expect.
Platform Support We will attempt to support all operating systems releases currently supported by the OS vendor except where there is a compelling reason not to.
Current major operating system support lies in the following:
Centos Ubuntu Redhat Amazon Linux 2 macOS Windows Some cookbooks are not designed to support all of these operating systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="summary mb-2">
<h2 class=title-summary><a href=https://sous-chefs.org/docs/forking/>Forking to Sous Chefs</a></h2>
<p>Where it is not possible to contact the existing owner and transfer ownership to the sous-chefs, we can take over maintenance of a codebase by creating a hard fork.
Adoption Note If adopting an existing cookbook you must use the current name to carry on support for the existing user base. In this case please see cookbook transferring
Before you begin A hard fork is not the friendliest approach, so we should make no other options are available.</p>

<div class="summary mb-2">
<h2 class=title-summary><a href=https://sous-chefs.org/docs/departure/>Leaving Sous Chefs</a></h2>
<p>If a maintainer wants to stop or leave, it&rsquo;s cool. We&rsquo;ll gladly point to the project&rsquo;s new home and keep an archive of the old history.
When the cookbook is for end-of-life tech If a cookbook is for software that&rsquo;s no longer feasible to keep running, like old open source, old commercial stuff, anything that can&rsquo;t be downloaded; then we update the cookbook README.md to mark as deprecated.
When the cookbook is unused If a cookbook seems entirely unused, we may want to stop claiming it is maintained.</p>

<p>Who we are
Board The board is responsible for those things that are not easily distributed.
enforce the code of conduct enforce licenses manage finances control access to community services This list should remain as small as possible. If it is possible to automate, it should be automated.
The board reserves the authority to do any lawful act necessary to operate the community, but we&rsquo;ll try to avoid wielding this hammer as much as possible.</p>
