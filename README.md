# sous-chefs.org

The website is created using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Development

```
brew install hugo

git clone git@github.com:sous-chefs/website
cd website
hugo server -ws .
```

This will run a local hugo server that watches for changes to the source files.
There will be a section in the output showing which port the site is served on.
